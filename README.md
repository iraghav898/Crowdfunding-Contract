This Solidity smart contract implements a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users can contribute ETH towards a funding goal. The contract includes key features such as:

✅ Minimum Contribution System – Only users contributing above a threshold can participate.
⏳ Deadline & Target Logic – Funds must be raised before the deadline and meet the target, or users can claim a refund.
🗳️ Governance via Voting – Contributors vote on spending requests, ensuring funds are only released with majority approval.
🔐 Access Control – Only the manager (contract creator) can create and execute payment requests.
📤 Transparent Fund Management – Contributors can view contract balance and track spending requests.
